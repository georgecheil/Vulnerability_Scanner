# vulnerability_scanner

This is a vulnerability scanner tool that you can define the softwares banner you whant to check 

In a file (ex. vulbanners.txt) the banners from the software used can be pre defined to scan the targets' open ports 

Fistly the target must be defined by giving an ip address or a domain name

Then the amount of ports to scan (if 100 is given the program runs ports 1 to 100 etc.)

And in the end the path to the file that contains the specified banners
